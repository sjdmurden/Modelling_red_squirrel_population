# Modelling_red_squirrel_population

This is a big group project from my university studies where me modelled the role of disease in the decline of red squirrels in the UK. A lot of statistics and differential equation calculations were used for our population models. We looked at exponential growth, logistic growth, the Lotka-Volterra model, and the SIR model. Our research discussed transmission coefficients, mortality and reproduction rates, time to extinction, to name a few, and examined the population dynamics between the red and grey squirrels when squirrel pox is introduced. We also experimented with our code and looked at what would happen if we changed some of our parameters. Obviously this created situations we hadn't seen before so we had to work together to adjust and explain our findings.

The four of us put this together using R and Python, and was formatted into a PDF using LaTeX. We also presented this to our tutors with the help of Beamer slides we made using LaTeX.
